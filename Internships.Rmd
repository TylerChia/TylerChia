## Player Profile App (Shiny Web App) <i class="fab fa-r-project"></I>

Continuing my work as a data analytics intern for UCSB's D1 baseball team, I created a player profile web application using RShiny that visualizes various statistics for each type of player on the team.  Pitchers, hitters, and catchers all have different stats displayed as well as differing visualizations. The goal of this app was to let the players and coaches see how well they are doing within the specified date range in comparison to the rest of the team as well as to see how they have improved over time and what they can do to improve in the future.  Warning: Plots make take a moment to load in due to the amount of data being processed.  Plots look best when viewed on a laptop or desktop.  This took me a very long time so please enjoy it LOL.

Instructions:

- On the left-hand sidebar, select the baseball position that you want to view stats on: Pitchers, Hitters, or Catchers
- In the "inputs" section, select the name of the player you want to see as well as a date range
- View statistics and beautiful plots

## Relationship Between Pitcher Workload and Ball Variables (Shiny Web App) <i class="fab fa-r-project"></I>

During the Fall of 2021 I started a data analytics internship with UCSB's Data Analytics Team for their Division 1 Baseball Program.  For Fall quarter my main project was to develop an RShiny web application that visualizes the relationship between pitcher workload and ball variable data over time.  The workload data was taken through Motus while the ball variables were obtained through a machine called Trackman.  Workload variables include aspects such as arm strength and mobility while ball variables include things such as velocity, spin rate, strike percentage, release position, and vertical/horizontal break.

Instructions:

- Select a pitcher from the dropdown on the left
- Select “Workload” on the left to see the pitcher’s baseline workload stats and their ranking on the team
- Then select a pitch type from the dropdown and select “Ball Variables” on the left in order to see their pitch metrics over time specific to each pitch type
