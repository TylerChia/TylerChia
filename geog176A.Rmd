During the summer of 2020, while stuck in quarantine, I took six classes, one of which was a GIS course based in R. Out of the three coding classes I took this summer, this GIS course was the most hands-on and provided me with the most experience for data science.  Below is a collection of links for all the projects that I completed.

## [Building  a project website](https://github.com/TylerChia/TylerChia.git)

- In this project, I learned how to utilize both Rmarkdown and Github Pages to author a static website
- Helped me understand file paths and creating directories for raw data, images, Rmarkdown files, and R scripts
- "Committing" files to git and "pushing" changes to GitHub
- Includes a github repository for access to all the code
- Learned how to display my work in a way that is visible to the public
