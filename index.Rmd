# Hello, My Name is Tyler Chia.
</center>

<center>
Though I am originally from the city of San Francisco, I am currently a second-year student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am an economics and statistics and data science double major and am minoring in both spatial science and technology management. I enjoy coding and testing my problem solving abilities. Through this website, I plan to display my work done through various classes and projects that I take on during my time in college.
