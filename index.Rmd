# Hello, My Name is Tyler Chia.
</center>

<center>
Though I am originally from the city of San Francisco, I am currently a fourth-year student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am an economics and statistics and data science double major and am minoring in spatial science and technology management.  I love to expand my range of knowledge across various topics which is perfect for data science as it is an inter-disciplinary field.  For the 2021-2022 school year, I will be a data science fellow for the Central Coast Data Science Partnership as I hope to gain valuable mentorship while simultaneously being an advocate for data science on my campus.  Through this website, I plan to display my work done through various classes, projects, and research that I take on during my time in undergrad.
