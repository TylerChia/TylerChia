Honors Contract Project.  In this project, using a combination of data science methods and thorough research, I proposed a mitigation strategy that requires certain homeowners, based on the purchase price of their house, to install solar panels as a way of reducing carbon emissions.

Right before Fall quarter 2020, I participated in a Datathon hosted by the UC system and ImagineScholar.  The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize data about energy and load shedding in South Africa.  My partner and I decided to see if there is a correlation between instances of load shedding and international/foreign investment to see if load shedding was impacting the economy.

During the summer of 2020, I took an online data science class that taught me the basics of data science specifically in python.  The two links below are the two projects that I completed for the class.  The first is based on a dataset pertaining to 911 calls in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in 2015 and 2016.  The second is based on bank stocks from 2006 to 2015.  Below the links are a few bullet points that display what I learned through these projects.

- Though these are relatively basic data science projects they gave me practice using python as a language as I am accustomed to using R
- Learned how to use Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown
- Practice using Pandas and Numpy to read in csv files and data wrangle
- Utilized various data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
