During the summer of 2020, I took an online data science class that taught me the basics of data science specifically in python.  The two links below are the two projects that I completed for the class.  The first is based on a dataset pertaining to 911 calls in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in 2015 and 2016.  The second is based on bank stocks from 2006 to 2015.  Below the links are a few bullet points that display what I learned through these projects.

- Though these are relatively basic data science projects they gave me practice using python as a language as I am accustomed to using R
- Learned how to use Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown
- Practice using Pandas and Numpy to read in csv files and data wrangle
- Utilized various data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
